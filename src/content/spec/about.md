# Hello!

My name is Dennis, I'm fourth year student at the `Schulich School of Business` pursuing a double specialization in `Finance` and `Business Analytics` (expected graduation 2026). 

I’m passionate about `financial markets`, `corporate finance`, and `investment analysis`. Through my coursework and extracurricular involvement, I’ve gained experience in `stakeholder management`, `partnership strategy`, `professional outreach`, `negotiation`, and `project coordination`. 

I’ve also participated in several finance case competitions and student investment clubs, where I’ve had the opportunity to `analyze companies, pitch investment ideas, and work on real-world business problems`.

Outside of academics, I serve as a `tutor` with TutorBright, where I support students in `developing their skills and confidence`.

Additionally, I love playing strategy board games, exploring the city, and running a small art business with my partner @pagedraws.

I’m currently `seeking` internship opportunities in `corporate finance, financial analysis, or financial consulting`, where I can further develop my skills and contribute to dynamic, high-performing teams.

I’m still learning and growing, both as a mentor and a student, and I’m eager to take on `new challenges` that help me develop personally and professionally.

Feel free to further explore my website!
